== Introduction

An earlier article described https://hackernoon.com/how-the-creators-of-git-do-branches-e6fcc57270fb[Gitworkflow]. This
document goes into more details, focusing on a task-oriented visual presentation to make using gitworkflow as simple as
possible.

== Concepts

See link:./concepts-summary.adoc[Concepts Summary]

== Tasks

All of the below summaries given using the git command line. Learn it!

=== Developers

==== Creating and Developing a Topic

Topics are usually created by branching from `master`. Sometimes, from `maint`.

*Question*: Is this topic eventually going to be merged to the existing release?

* If *yes*, then branch from `master`
* If *no*, then branch from `maint`

WARNING: Never commit directly to `next` or `pu` without a topic branch -- these changes will be lost.

Brush up on these commands and concepts:

* git https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout[checkout] -b
* git https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit[commit]
* git https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase[rebase] -i
* git https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push[push]

===== Examples

Create a new topic branch from `master` (see the link:./concepts-summary.adoc[Concepts Summary] for a good naming
convention):

 (master) $ git checkout -b topic-branch

Switched to a new branch 'topic-branch'

 (topic-branch) $

Now develop your topic, committing as you go. Write good commit messages. Use git rebase to make an easily reviewable
series of commits.

Once your branch is ready for a review (or simply to back it up), push it to the server:

 (topic-branch) $ git push --set-upstream origin topic-branch

You can continue to work on this branch, and use git push to make your changes visible for code review.

If you have long-running development of a feature, you will probably fall behind the `master` branch. If your branch has
not been merged to another branch (e.g., `next`) yet, you can rebase/replay your changes on top of the latest `master`
using

 (topic-branch) $ git rebase master

You can continue to interactively rebase a topic to make an easily reviewable series of commits until your branch has
been merged to `next`. After that, generally only push new commits to your branch (you can still rebase new commits
locally before pushing to the remote).

 (topic-branch) $ git rebase -i master

==== Depending on Another Topic

Oh oh, you need to develop some work that depends on another topic that has not yet been merged to `master`. Do not
base your work on `next`. Instead, create your topic and merge the other topic into it. This explicitly records the
dependency relationship between the topics, and puts the commit resolutions (if any) on the right branch.

Brush up on these commands and concepts:

* git https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge[merge] --no-ff

===== Examples

Branch `my-topic` depends on `frob-topic`

 (my-topic) $ git merge --no-ff frob-topic

=== Release Managers

The following tasks are useful to understand for everyone, but especially people who take on the role of release
managers (releasing to testing and prod environments).

[[TopicStabilizationMergeToPu]]
==== Topic Stabilization on Proposed

A topic is stabilized by first merging into `pu` (or "proposed updates"). The topic may be very raw and will probably
cause regressions or have other problems in its current state. Merging to `pu` provides opportunity for early feedback
on these problems, and also identifies topics that are conflicting so that the relevant devs can communicate and
determine a strategy.

Brush up on these commands and concepts:

* git https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge[merge] --no-ff <topic>
* git https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert[revert] -m 1 <merge-commit>

Topics merged to `pu` can still be interactively rebased. Therefore `pu` can always be rewound to `master` (or to just
before the rebased topic was merged), and everything from that point forward merged again ("rewind and rebuild").
Alternatively, the existing topic merge(s) can be reverted, and then the rebased topic merged again.

NOTE: When pushing `pu` back to the server, if there is a conflict because someone else pushed a change to `pu` at
the same time, do not do a merge pull. Instead, fetch `pu`, reset-hard to `origin/pu`, and then merge the topic
branch again. This keeps the history of the integration branch when viewed with `--first-parent` clean.

===== Examples

```
$ git checkout pu
(pu) $ git merge --no-ff topic-branch
```

===== Visualization

==== Topic Graduation to Next

A topic will generally be merged to `next` once technical and code reviews are complete, and perhaps some initial
testing via `pu` has been done. The topic may cause regressions or have other issues that may still need to be solved.
This generally represents all the development that is “done”, but will likely require more stabilization to fix
regressions or other issues based on user testing in a UAT environment.

A topic will spend as much time on `next` as necessary to stabilize the topic code.

From this point forward, the topic is generally not rebased -- only new commits are pushed to it, and merged to `next`
as necessary. However, this is not a hard-and-fast rule (see <<TopicStabilizationMergeToPu>> for techniques to deal
with a rebased topic branch previously merged).

See <<TopicStabilizationMergeToPu>> for the commands and concepts used.

NOTE: When pushing `next` back to the server, if there is a conflict because someone else pushed a change to `next` at
the same time, do not do a merge pull. Instead, fetch `next`, reset-hard to `origin/next`, and then merge the topic
branch again. This keeps the history of the integration branch when viewed with `--first-parent` clean.

==== Topic Graduation to Master

We expect to merge a topic to `master` as soon as that topic is considered stable via testing on `next`.

Not every commit on `master` (topic merges) need to form a “release”. In addition, even commits to `master` that *do*
form a release are not necessarily deployed to production. The `master` branch does represent our latest “best” code,
and will generally be run in production environments.

TODO

==== Create a Release

Verify that `maint` contains no commits that are also not present in `master`:

 $ git log master..maint

should return nothing. If it returns one or more commits, merge `maint` into `master` to preserve any maintenance
changes in future releases.

```
$ git checkout master
(master) $ git merge maint
```

Tag the latest (or a specific) version on `master` as a “release”.

```
$ git checkout master
(master) $ git tag -a “v2.7.0” v2.7.0
```

Copy the existing maintenance branch:

```
$ git checkout `maint`
(maint) $ git branch maint-2.6.4
```

Make a new maintenance branch:

```
$ git checkout maint
(maint) $ git reset --hard v2.7.0
(maint) $ git push --set-upstream origin +maint
```

You will likely now wish to <<RewindRebuildNext>> and <<RewindRebuildPu>>.

[[RewindRebuildNext]]
==== Rewind and Rebuild next

`next` may be rewound and rebuilt from `master` as often as needed. This will normally happen after a release.

Brush up on these commands and concepts:

* git https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset[reset] --hard master
* git https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge[merge] --no-ff
* git https://git-scm.com/blog/2010/03/08/rerere.html[rerere]
* See also alias git mb ("merge branch") when working with remote branches

The commands above may be used to semi-automate this process so that it can be run often -- once a day, or even as
needed.

A rebuild of `pu` might be needed if one or more topics have been rebased. This is relatively easy to semi-automate but
some open source tooling would be useful.

[[RewindRebuildPu]]
==== Rewind and Rebuild pu

`pu` may be rewound and rebuilt from `master` as often as needed. This will normally happen after a release.

A rebuild of `pu` might also be needed if one or more topics have been rebased. This is relatively easy to semi-automate
but some open source tooling would be useful.

TIP: A CI system may be configured to do this on an hourly or daily basis, automatically rewinding `pu` and merging in
all pending topics, building, and testing the result. This is a great way to catch conflicts between topics early.

* git https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset[reset] --hard master
* git https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge[merge] --no-ff
* git https://git-scm.com/blog/2010/03/08/rerere.html[rerere]

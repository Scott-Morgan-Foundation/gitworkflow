== Introduction

An earlier article described https://hackernoon.com/how-the-creators-of-git-do-branches-e6fcc57270fb[Gitworkflow]. This
document expands on some of the concepts in a shorter, more digestible form.

== Concepts

=== Topic Branches

Topic branches, sometimes called feature branches, are where almost all development happens. Topics represent something
being worked on, almost always in a branch, like a bug fix, hot fix, or new functionality.

Name topic branches according to some convention. A good one is your initials, a slash, the issue tracker ID, a dash,
and a (very) brief description in camel-case e.g.:

rg/SP-1234-NewFrobnik

The initials ease communication by immediately identifying the owner. The issue and description are short but also
provide useful context.

By branching from `maint` or `master`, we have the flexibility to merge the topic into branches like `next` or `pu`
because those branches will share the branch point as a common ancestor).

If topic B depends on another topic A that has not yet graduated to `master`, topic A may be merged into topic B. This
complicates interactive branch rebases so this should be avoided when possible, however if necessary, git should handle
this situation without too much problem.

Smaller bugfixes and features may be merged directly into `maint` or `master` without going through a stabilization
period in `next` or `pu`. Changes on `maint` are merged upwards into `master`, and changes on `master` are merged
upwards into `next` and `proposed` (though these branches are more often simply rewound and rebuilt).

=== Integration Branches

The integration branches are described here.

Stable releases are cut from `master`, beta or acceptance test releases from `next`, and alpha or preview releases from
`pu`. `maint` simply represents fixes to the previous release. The most stable up-to-date code is on `master`.

Integration branches are exactly like any other branch in git. What makes them “special” is solely in how we have
defined their use.

==== master

The `master` branch is:

* the code that is most up-to-date and stable

and it has the following properties:

* when creating a named new release, it would come from `master`
* in a continuous deployment scenario, production would always run the tip of `master`
* usually deployed to production, released to users
* at some point, the tip of `master` is tagged with vX.Y.0
* the `maint` branch is always based on some commit on `master`
* never rewound or rebased, *always safe to base topics on*
** you may want to add a check in your git server to ensure force push does not happen on this branch
* new topics are almost always based on `master`
* usually contains all of `maint` (and must before a new release, since otherwise there are changes currently in prod
that won’t be included in the new release)

==== next

The `next` branch is:

* the code currently being developed and stabilized for release

and it has the following properties:

* code merged to `next` is generally in fairly good shape, though perhaps there are regressions or other non-obvious
issues
* usually deployed to a testing environment
at the beginning of every development cycle, rewound to `master`, but otherwise never rewound
* usually contains all of `master` i.e. usually based on the head of `master`
* when a release is made, if a topic branch currently in `next` is not stable enough promotion to `master`, it is
simply not merged to `master` -- instead, it is merged to the next iteration of `next`
* may be rewound to `master` at any time, and rebuilt with topics still in `next` -- but usually after a release
* it is *never* merged into any another branch
* new topics are not usually based on `next`
** one exception: if a topic is not expected to be stable for the next release, and the creator understands that
the branch will need to be rebased when `next` is rewound and rebuilt, this is ok and may result in fewer conflicts
during future rebase than if the topic started from `master`

==== pu

The `pu` branch is:
* “proposed” updates for temporary analysis, experimentation, or initial testing/review of one or more features
** anything else that doesn’t yet belong in `next`

and it has the following properties:

* to test / provide early warning whether the unmerged topic branches integrate cleanly -- if not, some communication
to coordinate changes on topics is necessary
* may be rewound to `master` at any time -- but usually once every day or every second day
* it is *never* merged into any another branch
* new topics are not usually based on `pu`

==== maint (and maint-X.Y)

The `maint` branch is:

* code that is the newest maintained production release

The `maint-X.Y` branches are:

* code that are older, but still maintained, production releases

and they have the following properties:

* usually deployed directly into production, perhaps with some but not extensive testing elsewhere
* after release of `vX.Y.0` is made, `maint` is set to that commit
* releases of `vX.Y.n` are made from `maint` if `X.Y` is current, or `maint-X.Y` if `X.Y` is an older maintained release
* never rewound or rebased, *always safe to base topics on*
** you may want to add a check in your git server to ensure force push does not happen on this branch, with an exception
for when the `maint` branch is moved to the new tip of `master` after a release
* hotfix topics are merged to `maint` directly
* new topics may be based on `maint` (or `maint-X.Y`) if the fix in the topic needs to be applied to that older release
* can be merged to `master` to propagate fixes forward

= Gitworkflow

The https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/[git.git] project, responsible for the creation and maintenance of the
https://git-scm.com/[git] tool itself, uses an amazing workflow I call "gitworkflow", in deference to its creators
and the https://git-scm.com/docs/gitworkflows[man page] in which it is described.

I describe the advantages of this workflow, in comparison to the popular
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/[GitFlow] by Vincent Drieesen and Adam Ruka's
http://endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow[OneFlow] in a blog post titled
https://hackernoon.com/how-the-creators-of-git-do-branches-e6fcc57270fb[How the Creators of Git do Branching].

This repository is meant to be a place in which tools and documentation related to gitworkflow can be created.
